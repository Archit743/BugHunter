ID,Bug Line,Explanation
16,1,"The bug is in the line `rdi.smartVec().vecEditMode(TA::VECD);`. According to the documentation, `TA::VECD` is the VECD firmware command mode, which may not be suitable for the current context. The correct mode should be `TA::VTT` as shown in the correct code. This is because when `rdi.smartVec().label().copyLabel()` is used and different vectors in the same label are to be edited, only the `VTT` mode can be used to edit vectors."
32,2,"The vForce call on line 2 has a parameter value of 1 uA, which might be out of range. According to the documentation, the vForce function specifies a voltage to force, and the firmware command will be used to change vout. However, the unit of the parameter value is in amperes (uA), which is a unit of current, not voltage. This inconsistency suggests a bug in the code. Additionally, the correct code provided has a vForce call with a parameter value of 1 V, which is a unit of voltage, consistent with the documentation."
