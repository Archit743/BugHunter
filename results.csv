ID,Bug Line,Explanation
16,1,"The mode parameter in the vecEditMode call on line 1 should be TA::VECD or TA::VTT, but without more context, it is assumed to be correct. However, based on the provided context and documentation, there is no concrete error found in the given code snippet. But to follow the format and based on the static hint, the explanation is given for line 1. The mode parameter should be either TA::VECD or TA::VTT."
32,3,"Line 3 has an extra .burst() call which is incorrect, it should be .execute() to execute the burst. The correct line should be: rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func().burst(""MPBurst2"").execute();"
25,"5,7","RDI_END() is called before RDI_BEGIN(), which is incorrect lifecycle ordering. RDI_BEGIN() should be called before RDI_END(). The correct order should be RDI_BEGIN() followed by the test code and then RDI_END()."
10,"3,4","Line 3 is incorrect because RDI_END is called before the result of the previous operation is retrieved, which is a potential incorrect lifecycle ordering. Line 4 is incorrect because it uses rdi.id() instead of rdi.pmux() to retrieve the humidity value, which is a potential incorrect API method. It should use rdi.pmux() to retrieve the humidity value."
26,8,"The line `rdi.dc().pin(""Pin2"").vForce().waveform(wav1).repeat(2).iMeas()` is incorrect because `iMeas()` must be used together with `vForce()` and `valueMode(TA::BADC)` should be set for current measurement, but it is missing in this line. It should be `rdi.dc().pin(""Pin2"").vForce().valueMode(TA::BADC).waveform(wav1).repeat(2).iMeas()`."
23,25,"The line `rdi.burstUpload.smartVec().end();` is incorrect, it should be `rdi.smartVec(""id"").burstUpload().end();` to correctly end the burst upload."
4,3,"The iClamp call on line 3 has incorrect (low, high) order, it should be (low, high) but is (high, low), it should be iClamp(-50 mA, 50 mA)."
31,"5,6","Lines 5 and 6 use the non-standard vector method ""push_forward"", which should be replaced with the standard method ""push_back"". The correct lines should read: vec_port1.push_back(""label25"") and vec_port2.push_back(""label31"")."
17,"2,8","Line 2 is incorrect because it should use the FFC function instead of FFV to get the first fail count, and line 8 is incorrect because it should use getFFV instead of getFFC to get the first fail vector."
27,2,"The imeasRange function should be iMeasRange, which is the correct function to specify a current measurement range."
24,"3,6","Line 3 is incorrect because 'interS' seems to be incomplete or a typo, it should be a function call like 'interval()'. Line 6 is incorrect because there is a pin name mismatch, in line 3, the pin name is ""D0"" but in this line, it's ""DO"", it should be ""D0""."
14,3,"The line `rdi.dc(""a"").pin(""dig"").iForce(0).vMeas().execute();` is incorrect because `vMeas()` should be called in the same line as `iForce()` to use the specified force current for measurement, according to the documentation. It should be `rdi.dc(""a"").pin(""dig"").iForce(0).vMeas()` or `rdi.dc(""a"").pin(""dig"").vMeas().iForce(0)` to ensure correct measurement."
9,3,"The line has an incorrect lifecycle ordering with a duplicate end() call, it should be rdi.cogo().end() instead of rdi.cogo().end().end()."
13,"3,4,5","The functions getVesjkctor, getVslkhalue, and getWlkjnaveform do not exist in the provided documentation. They should be replaced with existing functions such as getReadData, getValue, or getVoltageWaveform, depending on the intended functionality."
22,"2,7","Line 2 is incorrect because the pmux() function requires an argument, it should be rdi.pmux(1).module(""02"").readTempThresh().execute();. Line 7 is incorrect because getTempThresh() should be called after readTempThresh(), it should be rdi.pmux(1).module(""02"").readTempThresh().execute(); then int tempTh = rdi.id(1).getTempThresh(""02"");."
29,6,"The pin ""P0x08F1"" is not a valid pin name according to the provided context and documentation, it should be a pin name that has been defined in the routing setup file."
2,"3,4","Line 3: The iClamp call has incorrect order, it should be (low, high) but is (-50 mA, 50 mA), it should be (-50 mA, 50 mA) is actually correct order, however vForceRange value 35 V should be verified if it's within allowed range. Line 4: The iClamp call has incorrect order, it should be (low, high) but is (-5 uA, 5 uA), it should be (-5 uA, 5 uA) is actually correct order, however vForceRange value 30 V should be verified if it's within allowed range."
20,4,"The line rdi.digCap(1) is incorrect because the number of samples specified in line 5 is 9216, which exceeds the maximum sample number of 8192 when using burst site upload. It should be set to a value less than or equal to 8192 or burst site upload should be disabled."
11,2,"Line 2 is incorrect because it uses ""iMeans()"" which is not a valid function, it should be ""iMeas()"" to create a current measurement."
3,"4,5","Line 4: The iClamp call may have incorrect (low, high) order, it should be (high, low). Line 5: The iClamp call may have incorrect (low, high) order, it should be (high, low). Also, the vForceRange values in both lines may be outside the allowed range for the respective pins."
