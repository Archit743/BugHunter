ID,Bug Line,Explanation
16,1,"The mode parameter in the vecEditMode call on line 1 should be TA::Mode, but it is given as TA::VECD, which is a value of the TA::Mode enum, not the enum type itself. It should be rdi.smartVec().vecEditMode(TA::Mode::VECD)."
32,3,"Line 3 is incorrect because it has two consecutive burst() calls, which is not a valid API call. It should be a single burst() call with the correct burst label."
25,"5,7","RDI_END is called before RDI_BEGIN, which is incorrect. RDI_BEGIN should be called before RDI_END to maintain the correct lifecycle ordering. The correct order should be RDI_BEGIN, followed by the test code, and then RDI_END."
10,"2,4","Line 2 is incorrect because it uses ""readHumanSeniority"" which is not a valid API, it should be ""readMux"" to read the status from the hardware. Line 4 is incorrect because it uses ""getHumanSeniority"" which is not a valid API, it should be ""getPmuxState"" to retrieve the read status for evaluating in a test method."
26,8,"Line 8 is incorrect because it uses .iMeas() without a preceding .vForce() call, which is required according to the documentation. It should be used together with .vForce()."
23,25,"The line `rdi.burstUpload.smartVec().end();` is incorrect, it should be `rdi.smartVec().burstUpload().end();` to correctly end the burst upload."
4,3,"The iClamp call on line 3 has incorrect (low, high) order, should be (low, high) but is (high, low), it should be iClamp(-50 mA, 50 mA) instead of iClamp(50 mA, -50 mA)."
31,"5,6","Lines 5 and 6 use the non-standard vector method ""push_forward"", which should be replaced with the standard method ""push_back"". The correct lines should read: vec_port1.push_back(""label25""); and vec_port2.push_back(""label31"");"
17,"2,8","Line 2 is incorrect because it should use the FFC function instead of FFV to get the first fail count, and line 8 is incorrect because it should use getFFV to get the first fail vector instead of getFFC to get the first fail count."
27,2,"The imeasRange function should be iMeasRange, which is the correct function to specify a current measurement range."
24,"3,6","Line 3 is incorrect because 'interS' seems to be incomplete or a typo, it should be a function call like 'interval()'. Line 6 is incorrect because there is a pin name mismatch, in line 3, the pin name is ""D0"" but in this line, it's ""DO"", it should be ""D0""."
14,3,"The vMeas() function is called without setting the force current in the same line, which will use iForce(0) for measurement by default, it should be set in the same line as vMeas() for correct measurement."
9,3,"Line 3 has an incorrect lifecycle ordering with a duplicate end() call, it should be rdi.cogo().end() instead of rdi.cogo().end().end()."
13,"3,4,5","Lines 3, 4, and 5 contain non-existent function names 'getVesjkctor', 'getVslkhalue', and 'getWlkjnaveform' respectively, which should be replaced with actual function names like 'getReadData' or 'getVoltageWaveform' as per the provided documentation."
22,"2,7","Line 2 is incorrect because the readTempThresh function requires no parameters, but a value of 70 is provided. It should be .readTempThresh(). Line 7 is incorrect because the getTempThresh function requires a module name as a string, but the syntax is incorrect. It should be rdi.id(1).getTempThresh(""02"")."
29,6,"The pin ""P0x08F1"" is not a valid pin name for the retrievePmuxPinStatus function, it should be a pin name that has been defined in the routing setup file."
2,"3,4","Line 3: The iClamp call has the wrong order, it should be (-50 mA, 50 mA) but the correct order is (low, high) so it should be (-50 mA is low and 50 mA is high, this is correct). However, vForceRange value 35 V may not be within the allowed range for the AVI64 pin. Line 4: The iClamp call has the correct order (low, high) as (-5 uA, 5 uA), but vForceRange value 30 V may not be within the allowed range for the AVI64 pin."
20,5,The number of samples (9216) exceeds the maximum allowed (8192) when burst site upload is disabled (line 1). It should be set to a value less than or equal to 8192.
11,2,"Line 2 is incorrect because it uses ""iMeans()"" which is not a valid function, it should be ""iMeas()"". Additionally, the unit for the current range is specified as ""2 mAh"" which is incorrect, it should be ""2 mA"" for milliamps."
3,4,"The vForceRange value (30 V) is less than the vForce value (31 V) for pin m_rMcd.sP_VS, which is incorrect. The vForceRange should be greater than or equal to the vForce value."
