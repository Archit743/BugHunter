ID,Bug Line,Explanation
16,1,"The mode parameter in the vecEditMode call on line 1 should be TA::Mode, but it is given as TA::VECD, which is a valid option for the mode, however, the correct syntax is rdi.smartVec().vecEditMode(TA::Mode), so it should be rdi.smartVec().vecEditMode(TA::VECD) is correct but the explanation is that the parameter should be one of the options of TA::Mode which includes TA::VECD."
32,3,"Line 3 has an extra .burst() call which is incorrect, it should be .execute() to execute the burst. The correct line should be: rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func().burst(""MPBurst2"").execute();"
25,"5,7","RDI_END() is called before RDI_BEGIN(), which is incorrect lifecycle ordering. RDI_BEGIN() should be called before RDI_END(). The correct order should be RDI_BEGIN() followed by the test code and then RDI_END()."
