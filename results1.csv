ID,Bug Line,Explanation
16,1,"The mode for editing vectors at runtime is set to TA::VECD, but it should be set to TA::VTT to edit vectors when different vectors in the same label are used."
32,"3,5","The lines 3 and 5 have an unnecessary second .burst() call. The correct code should be rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func().burst(""MPBurst2"") and rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func().burst(""MPBurst1"") respectively."
25,"5,7","RDI_END() is called before RDI_BEGIN(), which is incorrect. RDI_BEGIN() should be called before RDI_END() to maintain the correct lifecycle order. The correct order should be RDI_BEGIN() followed by the test code and then RDI_END()."
10,ERROR,Processing error: Connection error.
26,"5,9","Line 5 is incorrect because the addWaveform function does not support adding the same waveform multiple times with a specified count. Line 9 is incorrect because the addWaveform function is used with iMeas, but the correct function to use with iMeas is waveform, not addWaveform."
23,"7,25,30","Line 7 should be rdi.smartVec(""id"").begin().burstUpload() instead of rdi.smartVec(""id"").burstUpload().begin(), Line 25 should be rdi.smartVec(""id"").burstUpload().end() instead of rdi.burstUpload.smartVec().end(), Line 30 should use id1 or id2 instead of ""id"" in rdi.id(""id"").getReadBit(""DATA2"")."
4,3,"The vForce value (31 V) is greater than the vForceRange value (30 V) on line 3, which is a concrete error. The correct vForceRange should be greater than or equal to the vForce value."
31,"2,4,5,6,7",Line 2 is incorrect because there is no burst() function for the vector class in C++. Line 4 is incorrect because vec_port2 is not declared before use. Lines 5 and 6 are incorrect because there is no push_forward() function for the vector class in C++. Line 7 is incorrect because vec_port2 is not declared before use.
17,"4,8","Line 4 is incorrect because .FFV(10) should be .getFFV() to retrieve the first fail vector, not set it. Line 8 is incorrect because getFFC should be getFFV to retrieve the first fail vector."
27,"2,5","Line 2 should be rdi.dc().pin(""DPS_1,DPS_2"").iMeasRange(100 uA) because imeasRange should be iMeasRange, and line 5 should be rdi.dc(""im1"").pin(""DPS_0,DPS_1"").iMeas().write() because imeas should be iMeas."
24,"3,6","Line 3 has a missing function call or incorrect method name, it should be a valid method like execute(). Line 6 has a pin name mismatch between related operations, it should use ""D0"" instead of ""DO"" to match the pin name used in line 3."
14,"3,8","Line 3 is incorrect because the vMeas() function and its force current must be set in the same line for SmartRDI versions before 2.3.0. Line 8 is incorrect because getAlarmBurstValue() is not a valid function, it should be getBurstValue() or getAlarmValue() depending on the context."
9,3,"Line 3 has an extra .end() call, which is incorrect according to the lifecycle ordering rules. It should be rdi.cogo().end() instead of rdi.cogo().end().end()."
13,"3,4,5","Lines 3, 4, and 5 contain non-existent functions getVesjkctor, getVslkhalue, and getWlkjnaveform, which should be replaced with actual functions like getReadData, getValue, or getVoltageWaveform, depending on the intended functionality."
22,"2,7","Line 2 is missing a semicolon at the end of the statement, it should be rdi.pmux(1);. Line 7 is missing a semicolon at the end of the statement, it should be int tempTh = rdi.id(1).getTempThresh(""02"");."
29,6,"The pin name ""P0x08F1"" in line 6 is incorrect because it does not match the format of the pin names used in the previous lines, which are ""P0x01F1"" and ""P0x07F1"", it should be a valid pin name defined in the routing setup file."
2,"3,4","Lines 3 and 4 contain invalid units in the arguments, such as 'V', 'mA', and 'uA', which should be numeric values without units. For example, 'vForce(13.5 V)' should be 'vForce(13.5)' and 'iForceRange(50 mA)' should be 'iForceRange(50)'."
20,"1,5","Line 1 is incorrect because rdi.digCapBurstSiteUpload() should be used without an argument to get the current setting, or with a boolean argument to set the burst site upload capacity, but the provided argument ""false"" is correct according to the docs. However, line 5 is incorrect because the number of samples (9216) exceeds the maximum allowed (8192) when using burst site upload. It should be set to a value less than or equal to 8192."
11,2,"Line 2 is incorrect because it uses 'mAh' as the unit for current range, which should be 'mA'. Line 3 is incorrect because it uses 'uA' as the unit for current force, which should be 'mA' or 'A'."
3,"4,5","The vForce, vForceRange, iForceRange, and iClamp functions in lines 4 and 5 have invalid units ('V', 'mA', 'uA') which should be numbers without units. For example, vForce(31 V) should be vForce(31) and iClamp(-50 mA, 50 mA) should be iClamp(-50, 50)."
