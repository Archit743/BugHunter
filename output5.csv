ID,Bug Line,Explanation
16,1,"The mode parameter in the vecEditMode call on line 1 should be TA::VECD or TA::VTT, but without more context, it is assumed to be correct. However, based on the provided context and documentation, there is no concrete error found in the given code snippet. But, considering the provided documentation and context, the code seems to be using the correct API and lifecycle order. If we consider the possibility of an incorrect mode, it should be either TA::VECD or TA::VTT."
32,3,"Line 3 is incorrect because it has an extra .burst() call, it should be rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func().burst(""MPBurst2"").execute(); to match the correct syntax."
25,"5,7","RDI_END is called before RDI_BEGIN, which is incorrect. RDI_BEGIN should be called before RDI_END to maintain the correct lifecycle ordering. The correct order should be RDI_BEGIN, followed by the test code, and then RDI_END."
10,"2,4","Line 2 is incorrect because it reads ""HumanSeniority"" instead of the actual measured humidity, and line 4 is incorrect because it uses ""rdi.id()"" instead of ""rdi.pmux()"" and calls ""getHumanSeniority()"" which does not match the context of reading humidity. It should be using the correct API to read the humidity value."
26,"5,9",Line 5 is incorrect because the addWaveform function does not support adding the same waveform multiple times with a specified count. Line 9 is incorrect because the addWaveform function does not support adding the same waveform multiple times with a specified count. The correct approach would be to use a loop to add the waveform multiple times.
